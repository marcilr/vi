vi line editor


vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the
Unix operating system.  The portable subset of the behavior of
vi and programs based on it, and the ex editor language supported
within these programs, is described by (and thus standardized by)
the Single Unix Specification and POSIX.[1]

The original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the
visual mode for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with
Chuck Haley.[2]  Bill Joy's ex 1.1 was released as part of the
first Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix release in March 1978.
It was not until version 2.0 of ex, released as part of Second BSD in
May 1979 that the editor was installed under the name "vi" (which
took users straight into ex's visual mode),[3] and the name by which
it is known today.  Some current implementations of vi can trace their
source code ancestry to Bill Joy; others are completely new, largely
compatible reimplementations.
